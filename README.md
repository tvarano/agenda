# Agenda
If you are unable to run the program, there are two steps you might have to take.
Sorry.
First, if you get an error saying you need a JDK environment, go to Self Service > Updates and download Java_8U144.
If you have Eclipse, this is not necessary. 

Second, you will get a security error, saying the application is by an unidentified developer. 
Close the program. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General. Then run the program. 
You should see a message notifying you of the program in System Preferences and a button saying "Run Anyway"
Click "Run Anyway," and the program should run properly. 

If you have any errors, check the log (Documents/Agenda/Log.txt) and look through the messages.
