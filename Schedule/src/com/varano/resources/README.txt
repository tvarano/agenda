# Agenda
A scheduler program for Pascack Hills and Valley. Given the template schedules are correct, the user will be able to determine where they should be in school, how much time is left in their current activity, and their schedule for the day. They can take notes and keep their assignments in order for each class. The program is accessible, but is still in beta phase, with many new bugs popping up with every new addition. Eventually, the program will hopefully be exported with self service to both schools in the district, and can be modulated 
Upcoming features may include: 

More streamlined memo page
Self service support
Mobile support
